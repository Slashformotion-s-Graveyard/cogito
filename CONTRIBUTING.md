# How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`$ hugo version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in hugo-tufte, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
